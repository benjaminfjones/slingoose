Aftermarket enhancements for hackage.haskell.org

current-docs-link.js
--------------------

This is a userscript for documentation pages on [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) that adds a link to the current version of the package. This is useful to have when following links from Google to documentation on hackage since Google tends to rank docs for older versions of packages higher than docs for the current version. (Tested using Tampermonkey on Google Chrome)
